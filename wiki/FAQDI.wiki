= I just get a black screen =
  * only clusters sizes 32K and lower are supported
  * DI will always use the first partition if multiple are found
  * assure that you patched your 0000000E.app correctly with IOSKPatch i.e.:
    "IOSKPatch.exe 0000000E.app 0000000E_patched.app -s -d -v"
  * at least one game is required to boot
  * games must be put into the usb:/games folder in this format:
{{{
  usb:/games/GameName/files/<extracted game files>

  usb:/games/GameName/sys/main.dol
  usb:/games/GameName/sys/apploader.img
  usb:/games/GameName/sys/fst.bin
  usb:/games/GameName/sys/boot.bin
  usb:/games/GameName/sys/bi2.bin

  usb:/games/GameName/ticket.bin
  usb:/games/GameName/cert.bin
  usb:/games/GameName/tmd.bin
}}}

= I can't open the SNEEK menu =
    * You must HOLD the ONE button on the first wiimote in the system menu to open the menu.
    * A file with a bitmaped font is required for the menu to work and is expect at sd:/font.bin

= I get "This disc can not be read" =
    * Assure that the selected region matches your system menu's region, you can change the region within the SNEEK menu (hold 1 to open the menu, press B to switch to the settings menu)
    * System menu 4.2 has improved region checking without a patch, to either the system menu or the game, foreign games won't boot (SNEEK includes patches for 4.2E and U)

= Game shows up in the game channel but when booted stays at a black screen =
   * normally if this happens the game tried to switch the video mode which in some cases is forbidden and causes the game to stop. i.e. EUR console trying to load an USA game.
    Try to enable the video mode patch within the settings menu of SNEEK otherwise the only other solutions are to directly patch the game or change the video mode of your console.
   * Assure that the IOS version the game runs on is installed
