= Requirements =

 * [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&package_id=160396 devkitPro]
 * devkitARM (included in devkitPro, but most people didn't install it)
 * a SVN-Client ([http://www.sliksvn.com sliksvn], [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org tortoisseSVN], or other)
 * [http://www.python.org/download/ Python interpreter]

= Introduction =

Setting up the requirements above is not handled here. You'll find guides for these online.
*Note*: As of 13.03 or any SVN revsion above r17, there is a new di module, for more information see the dimodule wiki page..

= Creating a NAND filesystem dump =
There are two main ways to get your NAND filesystem dumped. The first one is using crediar's FSDumper _(other Filesystem Dumpers should work, too)_ and the second features a `BootMii` nand.bin, which get's unpacked by a tool. This way should be prefered if there is already a `BootMii` backup, that is at a considerable state.

== Using FSDumper ==

*1.* Download our very own [http://sneek.googlecode.com/files/FSDumper.zip FSDumper].

*2.* Start it using your prefered method, e.g. via Homebrew Channel or Bannerbomb.

*3.* Press *(1)* on your WiiMote to start the dumping process. FSDumper will automatically place all files in the correct spot on your SD card. As a result you would get this folders on your SD's root:
  * import
  * meta
  * shared1
  * shared2
  * sys
  * ticket
  * title
  * tmp

*4.* Place these folders on the SD card you want to use with SNEEK.

== Using a BootMii nand.bin ==

*1.* Get your nand.bin file ready and download & unpack [http://www.gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=179630 NAND Extractor]. Note, that it requires .Net Framework 3.5

*2.* In NAND Extractor choose "File" » "Open", choose your nand.bin and click "OK".

*3.* You should now see the file-/folderstructure. Click "File" » "Extract All" and let it unpack the dump to the root of your SD card. After unpacking is done check the integrity of the dump with the above list.

= Downloading the source =

To download the source you need an Subversion (short: svn) client. With it you can download the complete source of SNEEK (and other code.google projects) in one run.

In the following I will shortly explain how to download the source using sliksvn:

*1.* Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want the source to be placed. I'm choosing my Wii projects folder here:
{{{
C:\>k:

K:\>cd coding\c\wii

K:\Coding\C\wii>
}}}

*2.* Now simply enter the the command presented at the "Source Checkout" page:

   [http://det1re.de/a/sneek/sneek_source.png]

*3.* You can also modify the command via altering the subfolder for SNEEK from the default {{{"sneek-read-only"}}} to {{{"sneek"}}} or anything. However sliksvn will then download the latest source files. You can now go on compiling the files.

[http://det1re.de/a/sneek/sneek_div.png]
= Compiling =

*1.* After you downloaded the source code, get [http://sneek.googlecode.com/files/SNEEK_BATCH-v2.zip this archive]. It includes three files of which one is a Batch. 

*2.* Extract these files to a directory of your choice (note, that they have to stay together in order to get the batch to work)

*3.* start SNEEK.bat _from cmd *(!)*_. If you start it by double clicking it could happen that your installed devkitPro is not found.

*4.* it will ask you to insert the complete path to the dir, where you downloaded the SNEEK source. In my case, I have to input 
{{{
Please insert the complete path to the SNEEK source code:
   - K:\coding\c\wii\sneek
}}}

*5.* The batch will ask you for your Python installation directory is installed. Insert the same way as with SNEEK
{{{
Where is Python installed (i.e. "C:\python26"):
   - C:\python26
}}}

*6.* The batch will now starts compiling the modules. Don't worry if there are warnings, as long as it outputs someting like this to you after it finished compiling it went good:
{{{
Copying files
   - compiled files
        1 file(s) copied.
        1 file(s) copied.
        1 file(s) copied.
   - precompiled tools
        1 file(s) copied.
        1 file(s) copied.
}}}
If it says, that a file could not be found, check the logs and try to fix the problem. I've noticed, that you might need to run the batch multiple times, but it will succeed... 

*7.* An Explorer will pop up and the batch will ask about IOS60's 0000000e.app _(size: 162kb)_. Get it using [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUS_Downloader NUSD] and place it in the directory the Explorer shows. A how to on NUSD is found near the end of this [StartupGuide#Using_NUSD_to_acquire_0000000e.app article].

*8.* Return to the batch and hit ENTER to let it finish.

*9.* Pressing ENTER again wiil open another Explorer with the directory that has all files, that need to be copied to your SD. You successfully built SNEEK. The perfect run (without compiling messages) should look like this:

= Using NUSD to acquire 0000000e.app =

*1.* Download [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUS_Downloader NUS Downloader].

*2.* Get the key.bin file (also known as common-key.bin) and place it in the same directory as NUSD. You can find that file on the Internet or use a tool named `MakeKeyBin.exe`, also found on the Internet.

*3.* Click "Database" and choose "IOS" » "000000010000003C - IOS60" » "v6174".

   [http://det1re.de/a/sneek/sneek_nusd.png]

*4.* Check the "Decrypt" option and "Start NUS Download"! NUSD will now download the modules of IOS60-v6174.

*5.* In the same folder as nusd.exe there is an dir called "000000010000003Cv6174". Open it and you will find your "*0000000e.app*". That's the file you want. Also, go sure you are copying the .app file. There is an "0000000e", too — but this one is not decrypted and thus can't be used for SNEEK.
